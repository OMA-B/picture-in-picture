# picture-in-picture

This is just a project that uses the browser's mediaDevices API to create a mini pop-up window to display whatever want, as well as stream videos(as in MX Player mobile app), while other things in the background

The bummer is it's not supported on mobile devices yet, so it can only work on desktop devices... give it a test below, hope you find it helpful:

I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through or understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
